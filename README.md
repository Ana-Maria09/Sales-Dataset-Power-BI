📊 Sales Data Analysis using Power BI & Excel


📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data using Power BI and Excel. The goal is to extract insights, create visualizations, and perform calculations using DAX functions and Power Query (M Language) for data transformation.

Key aspects of this project include:
✅ Data Cleaning & Transformation using Power Query
✅ Sales & Profit Analysis by Category, Year, and Country
✅ Map Visualization for Profit by Country
✅ DAX calculations for aggregations, filters, and time intelligence

🗂️ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of sales records across different countries, including details such as:

Order Date 📅
Customer Name 👤
City & Country 🌍
Sales & Profit 💰
Shipping Details 🚚
📊 Power BI Visualizations
🔹 Total Sales by Category

The Technology category has the highest sales, followed by Office Supplies and Furniture.
🌍 Profit by Country

🖩 DAX Functions Used
In Power BI, I used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions to perform calculations and aggregations:

🔢 Common DAX Functions
1️⃣ Aggregation: SUM(), AVERAGE(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
2️⃣ Logical: IF(), SWITCH(), AND(), OR()
3️⃣ Filters: FILTER(), ALL(), RELATED(), LOOKUPVALUE()
4️⃣ Time Intelligence: TODAY(), TOTALYTD(), PREVIOUSMONTH()
5️⃣ Math & Stats: ROUND(), DIVIDE(), RANKX()
6️⃣ Text Functions: CONCATENATE(), LEFT(), RIGHT(), SEARCH()

🔍 Power Query (M) Functions Used
For data transformation, I used Power Query (M language) functions, including:

Text Functions: Text.Upper(), Text.Combine()
Number Functions: Number.Round()
Filtering Data: Table.SelectRows()
Date Functions: Date.From(), Duration.Days()
🚀 How to Use This Project
1️⃣ Download the Power BI file from the repository.
